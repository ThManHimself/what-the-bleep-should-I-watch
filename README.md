# What The *BLEEP* Should I Watch!?!?

## Millions of people enjoy getting out of their own heads, especially in the age of COVID. The streaming services have taken over control of our viewing. For many of us we have reached the end of everything we  wanted to see. The question is, "Whats Next?" What The *BLEEP* should I watch answers, just that. Rather than your streaming service deciding what you should watch next based on your viewing history, we are puting the control back in the hands of the user.

## Users will have the ability to choose which type of Movie they would like to watch based on the MPAA(Motion Picture Association of America) rating, and one or multiple of up to 18 genre types.

## These search functions will display 10 titles that meet your criteria. That's great you might say, now where do I watch? We  solved this problem as well. It's annoying as *BLEEP* to find a title that you want to watch, just to search several streaming services, wasting your time to find out it is not available. Copy and paste the movie title in the streaming services where to watch and we will display not only where the title is available to stream, but also a link which will take you directly there. Catastrophe overted. 

## The development team chose to use Javascript to create dynamic elements that would improve the functionality of the site. 

## We used server side API's to provide the users with a database of thousands of movies and the Streaming services they are available on. It was easier to pull the data from servers that had already been created. 

## The server side API's used were THE Moviedb and Watchmode.

## The framework for the CSS or appearance of the site was implemented by Materialize. Materialize enabled the team to adjust the appearance of the buttons and format the pages layout. 

## HTML provided the skeletal or basic structure of the page. 

## The live page can be viewed at :

## Nothing special needs to be done to run the Apoplication. Just use the interface that has been provided. If you encounter an error, reload the page and continue.


## There were issues with the functionality of some of the API's. I believe in the future when we work on projects we will probably try to spend more time researching the API's. This should enable us to implement all of the functionality we are looking for more easily.

##  In the future we hope to implement a resource for the user that will display which genres they are selecting. This will allow people to either see what genres they prefer, or even give them the ability to view something outside of the normal scope of what they watch.

## We also plan to implement the use of Movie Posters, to make the site more appealing, and possibly increase the number of movies displayed. Part of the functionality that we think the user will enjoy is not being overwhelmed scrolling through 20 pages of results.
