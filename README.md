# What The *BLEEP* Should I Watch!?!?


### CHECK GITHUB often to see what others are doing so you dont interfere with their work.

### COMMUNICATION is very important in a small group project. Let others know when you're working on any given feature. One easy way to effectively communicate is to create(if it doesnt already exist) AND comment on an issue in the issues tab of the GitHub repo. Make sure to include a short description of what you plan on doing during this session. If you run into problems, you can also use the comment section of that issue to express what you're going through. Very effective way of searching for help solving an issue you are running into while working.

### STAGE COMMIT AND PUSH your work eften so others can stay up to date with your work when they do a 'GIT PULL'

### DO NOT FORGET TO 'GIT PULL' FROM THE BRANCH YOU ARE GOING TO BE WORKING IN EVERY TIME YOU START A SESSION!!! Skipping this could cause trouble for yourself and others working on the project.


## Please be sure to work in a branch specifically created for the part of the project you are going to be working on. If there isn't one, create one from your console. When that branches task/purpose has been completed, try to remember not to continue working on something else in that same branch. !!! STAGE, COMMIT, PUSH AND MERGE !!! your work to the 'parent branch'(most often the DEVELOP branch)' and start with a fresh branch on the next task at hand. 
* When creating branches in a group project, 'GIT PUSH' the branch to the GitHub repo immediatly after creation so others can see that there is a branch being worked on for that part of the project. If you want to work in that branch, 'GIT PULL' from that branch so your code is up to date with what others have done so far on that branch.
